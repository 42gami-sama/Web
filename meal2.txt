Takoyaki (たこ焼き or 蛸焼) or "octopus balls" is a 
ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based 
batter and cooked in a special molded pan. 
It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus (tako), 
tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger (beni shoga), 
and green onion (negi).The balls are brushed 
with takoyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce) 
and mayonnaise, and then sprinkled with green laver (aonori) 
and shavings of dried bonito (katsuobushi).
