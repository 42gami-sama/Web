Taiyaki (鯛焼き) is a Japanese 
fish-shaped cake, commonly sold as street food. It 
imitates the shape of tai (鯛 red seabream), which 
it is named after. The most common filling is red bean paste 
that is made from sweetened azuki beans. 
Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, 
or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, 
gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.
